# Team1982 Learn to Code
This repository is for new programmers at SMNW Team 1982 Robotics, it has a few examples in different styles to teach principals for programmers new to robotics and python too.

# Setup
To start with this project, you should have Visual Studio Code installed, which is available in Manager.
Also, install GitHub Desktop from [here](https://desktop.github.com/download/), and create a GitHub account. I will add you to this repository and give you commit access so you can share your code.
Lastly, you need to install python on your MacBook. This can be done by opening 'Terminal' from Launchpad, and typing 
```
xcode-select --install
```
You can now run python files on your MacBook, by running 
```
python3 python-file.py
```
Pro Tip: VSCode also has a built-in terminal so you don't have to switch windows too much. You can open this by pressing the control key, the shift key, and the ~ key at the same time.

Finally, clone this repository through GitHub desktop and create a branch with your name. I will go over this at our meetings if you need help.
