# The __init__() Function
# The examples above are classes and objects in their simplest form, and are not really useful in real life applications.
# To understand the meaning of classes we have to understand the built-in __init__() function.
# All classes have a function called __init__(), which is always executed when the class is being initiated.
# Use the __init__() function to assign values to object properties, or other operations that are necessary to do when the object is being created:
class Person:
  def __init__(self, name, age):
    self.name = name
    self.age = age

p1 = Person("John", 36)

print(p1.name)
print(p1.age)



# The __str__() Function
# The __str__() function controls what should be returned when the class object is represented as a string.
# If the __str__() function is not set, the string representation of the object is returned:

#The string representation of an object WITHOUT the __str__() function:

class Person:
  def __init__(self, name, age):
    self.name = name
    self.age = age

p1 = Person("John", 36)

print(p1)

#The string representation of an object WITH the __str__() function:

class Person:
  def __init__(self, name, age):
    self.name = name
    self.age = age

  def __str__(self):
    return f"{self.name}({self.age})"

p1 = Person("John", 36)

print(p1)


#Object Methods
# Objects can also contain methods. Methods in objects are functions that belong to the object.
# Let us create a method in the Person class:
